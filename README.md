# NumPy-Fraud-Analysis
🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection – NumPy & Matplotlib Mini Project
📌 Overview
This project analyzes credit card transactions using NumPy for data processing and Matplotlib for visual insights. It explores fraud detection patterns based on transaction amounts and highlights the differences between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
